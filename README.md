Package `pump` provides a minimalist framework for composing data processing pipelines.
The pipelines are type-safe, impose little overhead, and can be composed either statically,
or dynamically (for example, as a function of configuration).

For more details see [documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/maxim2266/pump).

#### Project status
Tested on Linux Mint 21.2, requires Go version 1.19 or higher.
